# Spotify-Playlist-AI-UseCase

🎶 100 Hits of 2000 – Playlist + AI Article

_Ever wondered what defined the year 2000 in music? This project brings it to life in 100 iconic hits – plus an AI-written documentation to tell the story behind the code._

## What’s Inside

🐍 Python code using 🍜 BS4 and 🎶 Spotipy to create a playlist.

🐍 Python code using 🦾 OpenAI to get an assistant, since I am having a hard time writing even this ReadME 😅

#### Outputs:

🎧 The Ultimate [2000's Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6wWH3ogDWQkpi8RJqRX93S) in Spotify.

📰 AI-Powered Documentation to show-case the code.

## Next Moves:

- Have an aesthetic interface using ⚛️ ReactJS

## How to Try It 🌟 TBD 🌟
NOT TESTED YET
1. Clone the repo.

2. Install dependencies for Spotify App (see [AI-Doc](https://github.com/Carinaaa/Spotify-Playlist-AI-UseCase/blob/main/openai_docs_generator/README.md))

3. Install dependencies for OpenAI. Should I ask the model to documents its self? 😅

4. TBD: Check paths since I moved around in new folders....

## Disclaimer:

Based on project idea to create a playlist in Spotify from Angela Yu in [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/share/103J8C3@vnrVVxhI1qZTdMLdV_Iatu0nLNAYBzAowBIzqh1HgEwvnYZgRALgMQP0KjJCorp8Vw==/)

Hits list based on: https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/2000-08-12/

I got the hints on how to use OpenAI as my assistent from [LLM Engineering: Master AI, Large Language Models & Agents
